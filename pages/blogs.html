        <p>It’s not easy to stick with your goals. I don’t know about you, but it seems like I’m always setting goals hoping to cook more, exercise, or even to start and maintain a blog. Unfortunately, many of these goals are quietly abandoned, left to softly peter out in the dark recesses of the pit of procrastination.

        <p>The true paradigm shift occurs when you alter your lifestyle so that you meet your goals. Making life changes further solidifies the connection between your goals and your self-identity. As a young high school student, much of my life, in part was influenced by my goal to get into West Point...<a href="https://quaiwrites.com/2016/09/20/passion-series-part-4/">read more</a></p>
